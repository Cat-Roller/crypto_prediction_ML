this is a ML project i was working on 3 months trying to predict cryptocurrency prices
archive folder contains first steps and contains very simple codes
new model is the second stage where i was working on my model architecture
predicting direction is the final stage where i was working on target and input variables
to see how project works run long test files in new model and predicting direction
