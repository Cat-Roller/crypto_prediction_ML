this is a ML project i was working on 3 months trying to predict cryptocurrency prices.
Archive folder contains first steps and contains very simple codes.
New model is the second stage where i was working on my model architecture.
Predicting direction is the final stage where i was working on target and input variables.
To see how project works run: long test files in new model and predicting direction
